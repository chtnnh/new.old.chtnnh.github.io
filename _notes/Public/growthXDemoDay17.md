## Panelists
1. Aditya
2. Khilan
3. Saloni
4. Apoorv

## Scoring
1. 70% - research and documentation
2. 20% - panel
3. 10% - webinar audience (zoom.us)

## Meta notes around these notes
1. first time attending GrowthX demo day, some things were not obvious to me compared to someone who has been a part of the ecosystem
2. not using screenshots extensively, due to the confusion around if it's allowed/encouraged in Demo Day.
3. uploaded right after the webinar ending, forgive (and hopefully, correct) mistakes üôè

## Meta notes around GrowthX storytelling throughout DD 17
1. Engaging from the get go
2. Amazing music choice to pump up audience
3. Positive affirmations throughout for all stakeholders (audience, panelists, participants - presenters)
4. crazy work on graphics and videos - the effort shows and interests the right audience already
5. Amazing video on the CRAFT product by GrowthX, quite exciting to be very honest
  - Brand Led Growth with Swati (Ex Netflix India CMO)
  - Positioned quite like Masterclass
6. Small delights in team presentations are GrowthX standard, making it quite a great signal for the cohort itself (as a potential learner and for an employer as well)
7. positive reinforcements to the entire webinar audience with a great video on communities built on ambition :')

## Notes on team Open Money

### Lokesh
1. positive energy, but initial impression is not high _levels_ of energy
  1. caveat: making notes, so not super focused on chats
2. storytelling
  1. engaging based on the chat response by itself
  2. amazing way of positioning the numbers to emphasise the problem for audience
  3. amazing use of nostalgic ad and building a detailed story around beloved chintamani ji
    1. done through assuming relevant numbers and adding AI generated visuals
		2. spending just the right amount of time on chintamani ji before moving to next use case and the next
	4. due to the higher total presentation time per team, personally feel that the context setting via storytelling is getting tedious
		1. chat was disabled by GrowthX due to insane volume, probably a sign of restless energy in the audience to figure out the solution quicker (anecdotal and subjective opinion)
	5. goals and OKRs were defined early on and followed up on after every subsection of the solution - great addition
3. presentation
	1. confused about notion as a presentation medium of choice
	2. confusion clears when the specific potential customers' profiles are explained due to the great use of notion as opposed to traditional presentations
	3. agree with the choice for notion as medium, but still feel it could have been utilised more effectively
		1. lot of blank space
		2. text formatting could have been much better utilised in terms of sizes and emphasis via bold/italic/underline and colour
	4. all in all, graphics - great, text - not so much
4. engagement (apart from storytelling and presentation)
	1. very delightfully surprised to find chat with relevant stats and numbers sent by the presenting team themselves, amazing way of putting things in context that require greater time to explain
	2. post re-enabling chat, first message is from presenting team itself, who are now also answering audience questions
	3. also boosting positive feedback by engaging with those as well
5. presented research and solutions
	1. definitely very thorough, ties strongly into storytelling
	2. audience is given context, a mildly strong incentive to care, insights uncovered through research, research backing the insight and ways to relate to the insights given
	3. Partner Program
		1. audience is walked down the user funnel step-by-step
		2. generated AI video featuring SRK could've been much better given current tech, unsure of when exactly that video was made, but idea is great
		3. step-wise plans around influencer marketing, SEO, SEM
		4. amazing flowchart on in-person sales team strategy to generate and convert leads
		5. summary of the major points in the plan at the end
		6. cost-benefit analysis post the summary, glanced over pretty quickly imho
	4. Bank Partnerships
		1. white-labelling neo banking is quite the amazing idea in itself, reveals great insight into the problem (context: i have _some_ experience with white-labelled FinTech in India)
		2. explanation of the insight done amazingly, on why the banks would greatly benefit with this product
		3. question around RBI guidelines for neo banking only glanced over (in chat)
		4. identified target banks for the next 12 months
		5. explained the reason for selecting target banks, very well in case of the second example (UBI Bank)
		6. identified target decision makers in the banks as well
		7. time check happens now (~40 minutes into the presentation)
	5. Marketing
		1. ties back into insights already presented in Partner Program
		2. amazingly simple-to-follow logic around marketing insights
	6. Smaller bets the team is "extremely extremely bullish on"
		1. Smaller bet #1
			1. problem statement explained for user persona
			2. product demo with screen recording of prototype (not very thorough)
		2. Smaller bet #2
			1. insights explained well
	7. Monetisation
		1. great insights on lending for MSMEs
		2. sounds slightly too optimistic around NBFC integration timelines for the same
		3. "AI-assisted vernacular chatbot"
			1. it's in SRK's voice
			2. and is not really a chatbot, is a video of the product with SRK as a narrator
			3. redesigned the entire product too, which could've been more significant
6. Closing remarks
	1. sweet and short, but nothing that stuck with me personally
7. Post questions
	1. Ends the charming presentation with thanking his team for the entire effort, emphasising the collaborative nature of this project
## Panelist questions
### Aditya
1. Positive feedback definitely bullish on the overall strategy
2. Great signal for audience members such as myself (who may not have an extensive MSME FinTech background for India/Bharat)
3. Question
	1. Feasibility of converting HDFC given their low investment plans for neo banking
		1. Aditya is probably not converted on the topic, was neutral, remains neutral
### Khilan
1. Overall positive feedback again, seems to be the norm already given these 2 teams are the best from the cohort
2. Questions
	1. Echoing my sentiments on the seemingly optimistic timelines for NBFC integrations
		1. Lokesh answers only after expressing superb excitement towards Lokesh's expertise in the field and question
		2. Answers from an engineering standpoint, accounts for Open's limited engineering bandwidth, but doesn't really account for regulatory or bureaucratic timelines
	2. What would be your top 2 bets given limited resources as well as 15-20% of the bets reaching PMF?
		1. Putting least priority on NBFC and Bank partnerships which weakens the argument for the previous question as well
### Saloni
1. Overall positive feedback, especially for Bank Partnerships idea
2. Storytelling sticks, especially with panelists (based on ma'am's comments)
3. Lokesh continues to charm with personalised greets for each panelist
4. Question
	1. How do you incentivise the bank partners?
		1. Lokesh's nervousness seems to be getting the better of him right now, the explain needs to be re-explained to him
		2. Once calmer, Lokesh explains that the ground-level incentive will need to be worked out with the specific bank partner
	2. Between the three personas, who's primary?
		1. Chintamani - MSME persona
		2. Insight for the same is explained well (mostly emotional around MSME being the first user persona)
### Apoorv
1. Overall positive, echoing audience questions around unrealistic nature of timelines
2. Questions
	1. What has been Opens growth channels (in the past, not future)
		1. Missed it personally (sorry)
	2. How are you going to change habits of partners (CA referrers)
		1. Key incentive is money and ease of making that money
	3. Financial incentives don't work very well for MSMEs (in terms of profit growth), what alternatives?
		1. In-person expert conferences
## Personal remarks on team Open Money
1. coming from a (fairly) significant tech + AI background and (some) FinTech for India background, my comments are leaning towards the tech solutions, which show signs of not being the focus of the team, but given the context of GrowthX capstone, unsure of how relevant that is (hoping to get into GX18 myself xD)
2. Too optimistic with the timelines, with this sentiment being echoed throughout chat and panel
## Notes on team Orange Health
### Akanshaaa
1. neutral energy, but initial impression is fairly _low_ levels of energy
2. storytelling
	1. engaging based on the chat response by itself, like before
	2. the way the problem was presented seemed overly negative to me personally (but that maybe a bias as a lot of my friends and family are in the healthcare industry and some of them were literally called incompetent - caveat, ma'am spoke of only Phlebotomists and yet my first reaction was negative)
	3. amazing way of positioning the numbers to emphasise the solution (60-60-60)
	4. great use of numbers for showcasing superior CX (4.9 rating on Google Maps, etc)
	5. the speed of the presentation much slower than previous team, so much so that the chat had to be reassured that the product exists (Orange Health, in this case) and the team is only (going to) try and grow the product 
	6. questions in chat already seeming pessimistic, my initial thoughts as well not being very positive
	7. major efforts by the rest of the Orange Health team to mitigate/answer all questions in chat
	8. some network issues on ma'am's end, making the storytelling less effective
	9. 15 minutes into the presentation the OKRs are very clearly defined, but honestly i'm exhausted from the extended amount of focus required (a break between presentations would've been imperative in keeping this at bay i feel)
	10. overall, loosely connected story, hard to feel much about it as well (despite the great potential to make the audience feel about healthcare)
	11. decided not to write more about this, but instead of engaging with the healthcare story positively, i (again, personal and subjective) perceive the story as negative in the conversion of women suffering from chronic diseases into "power users" with "high lifetime value"
3. presentation
	1. graphics more comprehensive when constructing user personas
	2. much better use of fonts as opposed to previous team
	3. chat already appreciating the work on graphics and fonts
		1. chat too busy trying to find the contact of the designer to focus on the acquisition channels and AOV
		2. chat disabled again, but this time because of overly increased interest in design (DALL-E, etc as opposed to Growth metrics)
4. engagement (apart from storytelling and presentation)
	1. it becomes clear to me that much of the small delights from the previous presentation are GrowthX standard
		1. chat engagement, use of Generative AI, matching virtual backgrounds, brand colour themes and emojis, etc
5. presented research and solutions
	1. not as thorough as team 1, yet ties strongly into storytelling again
		1. emphasises the importance of (great) storytelling to me personally
		2. also underscores the _high_ pressure i very easily ignored when noting down points with the previous teams' storytelling, forgive pls üôè
		3. caveat: ma'am is surely a _good_ storyteller, but previous team placed a bullish bet by going first and won on that (Lokesh mentioned that when he chose to go first too, "like India in the World Cup, we will choose to bat first")
		4. google "McKee storytelling"
	2. building a subsection within the existing Orange Health app for pregnant woman is not optimal (imho, growth experiments are 0-1, focused -> easier to implement)
	3. building an AI health chatbot honestly seems to be undermining the complexity of the technical challenge that comes with such a project. hiding PII, complying with regulations around fitness and location data, etc is huge and infeasible at Orange Health scale.
		1. design stands out again
		2. time check happens right in between the demo of the beautiful dashboards for the fitness data
6. Closing remarks
	1. super convoluted summary, the entire flowchart barely fit on to my screen vertically
		1. voting now requires 85% participation as opposed to previous 80% due to 450 current participants as opposed to 600 at previous poll
		2. takes way longer to reach 85% participation as well this time
7. Post questions
	1. nothing, really

## Panelist questions
### Saloni
1. Overall positive about the design
2. Questions
	1. can focussing on helping pregnant women box the brand?
		1. justified with the long-term game when the kids grow up and mothers take healthcare decisions for them and their grandparents
		2. panel (and myself) not exactly convinced
	2. underscoring the _extremely_ optimistic nature of the tech plan
		1. mentions the partnerships (HealthifyMe, etc)
			1. does not answer why partners would be incentivised
		2. panel (nor myself) convinced again

### Apoorv
1. Overall _very_ positive about the design
2. Underscores the potential candid feedback from chat and panel due to the universal nature of the Orange Health target audience
3. Questions
	1. (re)highlighting the logical fallacy in focussing on pregnant women for growth
	2. (re)highlighting the importance of partnerships

### Khilan
1. Overall positive about the strategy
2. Questions
	1. Requesting an explanation for the heavy focus on paid advertising and brand positioning
		1. CAC is high due to unoptimised targeting so far
	2. Any other potential high-intent channels?
		1. high synergy partnerships explored and zeroed in to presented partners
		2. Khilan mentions other high-intent channels like Sugar.Fit that could have been zeroed in on
		3. answered again in chat post Khilan sir's drop from video, signal for not being on top of the material?

### Aditya
1. Overall positive about the design
2. Questions
	1. (re)highlighting pregnancy care focus
	2. highlighting lack of depth in cost-benefit analysis with proposed solutions
	3. main source of revenue in expansion - established players (1mg, etc), hospitals (manipal, etc) or local players
		1. local players

## Personal remarks on team Orange Health
1. coming from a (fairly) significant tech + AI background and (some) HealthTech background (was very recently building EHR systems for IVF clinics) I find the user personas to be too varied. Growth experiments are also 0-1 (in my very limited understanding of the same), the simpler, the better.
	1. luckily, they focus on 2 complementary user personas, but the question becomes, why were the other 2 given equal time to be explained, unsure.
	2. suggested solutions both are well-intentioned, but clearly lacking any major insights
		1. chronic care (for patients with PCOS/PCOD) requires specific focus
		2. building AI health chatbots is _too_ technically intensive
		3. expanding to more cities/states would be financially and technologically much easier
2. storytelling is what remains lacklustre throughout.
	1. to be honest, much of the (mine personally) negative feedback is around storytelling due to the negative emotions it incites
	2. while most of the positive feedback comes for the design and product work

## Results!!
Despite my spoilers throughout these (very biased) notes, Open Money wins, making it even more difficult for me to get rid of the aforementioned biases.

## Personal remarks on GrowthX Demo Day 17
